# Hello-World
My first Repository Creation
Hi everyone!

Srini here. I'm from India, did my Master's at UofM-Dearborn.
Currently I'm working at Toyota Motors North America R&D as a Quality Engineer focusing on Data Analytics.

I love to go on road-trips, hang out with friends, cook & try out new cuisines, listening to music.
